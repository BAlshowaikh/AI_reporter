# - This file documents the environment variables the app expects.
# - Commit THIS file to git (it's safe). Do NOT commit your real .env.
# - To use: copy this file to ".env" and replace placeholder values.
# NOTES
# - No secrets are required for the MVP. Delivery credentials (Telegram/email)
#   will be added later and documented here when needed.
# - Keep values simple (no quotes) unless the value itself contains commas
#   or special characters.
# - Line comments start with "#".

# --------------------------------------------
# RSS FEEDS (MIT News topics — no scraping)
# --------------------------------------------
# FEED_URLS is a comma-separated list of RSS feed URLs to fetch from.
# Start with MIT News topic feeds related to AI/CS/Robotics/Software.
# Use real URLs in your .env; placeholders below are SAFE EXAMPLES.
#
# Example shape:
#   FEED_URLS=https://example.org/mit-ai.xml,https://example.org/mit-cs.xml
#
# Tip: We'll keep these easily editable so you can add/remove sources later.
FEED_URLS=https://example.org/mit-ai.xml,https://example.org/mit-cs.xml,https://example.org/mit-robotics.xml,https://example.org/mit-software.xml

# --------------------------------------------
# FETCH LIMIT PER FEED (before selection)
# --------------------------------------------
# MAX_ITEMS limits how many recent items we pull from each feed before
# filtering/selection. Reasonable range: 10–50. Higher = more network work.
MAX_ITEMS=25

# --------------------------------------------
# TIMEZONE (for "today" logic & daily seeding)
# --------------------------------------------
# Use an IANA timezone name (NOT a Windows name).
# Since you're in Bahrain, this should be "Asia/Bahrain".
TIMEZONE=Asia/Bahrain

# --------------------------------------------
# RANDOMNESS & REPRODUCIBILITY
# --------------------------------------------
# We pick 3 items "randomly", but want runs to be reproducible.
# Choose one mode:
#   - today : seed is derived from the current date (stable within a day)
#   - fixed : seed is a constant (always the same output unless inputs change)
RANDOM_SEED_MODE=today

# Only used when RANDOM_SEED_MODE=fixed.
# Any integer is fine (e.g., 42, 1337, 123456).
FIXED_RANDOM_SEED=12345

# ============================================
# FUTURE KEYS (DO NOT ADD YET – for later days)
# --------------------------------------------
# Telegram / Email credentials will be added later in the project.
# When we get there, you'll COPY their names into .env.example with
# safe placeholders and put real values only in your local .env.
